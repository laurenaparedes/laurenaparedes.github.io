    <h1>ResilienceAI</h1>
    <h2>ResilienceAI is a cutting-edge startup group that I am proud to be part of for my senior capstone project. Our
        organization is dedicated to delivering innovative solutions to state and local governments to enhance community
        resilience, allocate resources more efficiently, and mitigate the impacts of climate change. Using machine
        learning and big data, we design web-based software, data visualizations, and mapping applications to identify
        areas that are susceptible to natural disasters and ensure equitable access to disaster resources. My
        contributions to the project include creating a low-fidelity prototype in HTML, designing wireframes to
        facilitate development, conducting empathy interviews to refine our understanding of user needs, and ensuring
        that the MVP's UI/UX is both coherent and visually professional.</h2>
    <h1> Minecraft Lava Mod</h1>
    <h2>As part of a two-member team, I developed a Minecraft mod extension, incorporating novel entities to the game.
        In the process, I acquired proficiency in Java and implemented Object-Oriented Analysis and Design (OOAD)
        principles. Furthermore, I gained practical experience in creating Unified Modeling Language (UML) diagrams and
        utilizing various APIs for animation purposes.</h2>
    <h1>Bloom</h1>
    <h2>Employing various Human-Computer Interaction techniques, I designed a Figma prototype for a plant-tracking
        application that facilitated logging and monitoring of watering schedules, Bloom. This involved developing
        personas, conducting user testing, and emphasizing iteration to enhance the prototype. Additionally, I created
        storyboards and conducted user interviews to refine the app's usability. I collaborated with a partner on this
        project, which resulted in an effective and efficient solution. </h2>
    <h1>Avoke Music Display</h1>
    <h2>Collaborating with a team of five, we developed a user-friendly web page called Avoke that enabled users to
        visualize music. The webpage was deployed on Heroku and incorporated EJS and Node.js code, along with a
        PostgreSQL database to securely store user login information. Our development process involved working with
        various programming languages such as HTML, JavaScript, CSS, and SCSS, to ensure a cohesive and engaging user
        experience.</h2>
    <h1>Robotic Duck Dance</h1>
    <h2>As part of a three-member team, we developed a robotic simulation named "A Day in the Park," utilizing Webots
        and implemented using Python and C coding languages. The simulation includes diverse robot types enjoying a day
        at the park, designed as an exclusive human-free environment. Specifically, the TIAGo steel "moms" navigate
        around the pond through the shortest path, while turtle bot "ducks" swim in groups. Additionally, E-puck "kids"
        are found in the playground area, avoiding obstacles while running around. Our project resulted in an engaging
        and interactive simulation showcasing our proficiency in programming and robotic design.</h2>
    <h1>Reggie!</h1>
    <h2> Reggie! is a user-centered phone application designed to assist college students in managing their time
        effectively. Developed by a team of six, our prototype incorporates various aspects of User-Centered Design
        (UCD) principles. We began with a discovery research phase, followed by the development of personas and
        scenarios, to gain key insights into our target audience. This led us to create current state Journey Maps and
        future state storyboards, which served as the basis for creating information architectures (IAs) and workflows.
        We used this to develop a Figma model, which our team used for the app's development. The end result is a
        convenient and intuitive application that addresses the unique challenges of college life.</h2>
