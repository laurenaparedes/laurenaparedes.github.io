        Hello and welcome! My name is Lauren Paredes, and I'm delighted to share a little bit about myself with you. As a senior studying computer science at the University of Colorado Boulder, I'm passionate about exploring the intersection of technology and creativity. Throughout my academic journey, I've developed a diverse set of skills in programming, data analysis, and problem-solving that I'm excited to apply to real-world challenges.
        But there's much more to me than just my academic pursuits. When I'm not coding, you'll find me playing piano, spending time with my dogs, or enjoying the company of my loved ones. I love to challenge myself with new piano pieces, and I find joy in the companionship and playfulness of my two dogs, a husky and a corgi. My family has always been a cornerstone of my life, and I feel grateful for their support and encouragement.
        As I prepare to graduate in May 2023 and embark on new adventures, I'm thrilled to invite you to explore my digital portfolio. The purpose of my portfolio is to showcase my technical skills, academic achievements, and personal interests, as well as to provide a glimpse into my personality and work style. Through my portfolio, you'll find examples of the projects I've completed during my time at CU Boulder, ranging from web development to machine learning. You'll also find a list of my academic achievements, including scholarships and leadership positions. Additionally, I've included a section on my personal interests, where you can learn more about my love of music, dogs, and travel.
        My hope is that my portfolio will give you a sense of who I am as a person and a professional. Whether you're a potential employer, collaborator, or just someone who's curious about my work, I welcome you to explore and connect with me. Thank you for taking the time to get to know me a little better!
